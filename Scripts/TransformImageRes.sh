# A simple script to run GDAL Warp on a set of input images (tifs).
# This script is to be used when a transformation is specified in 
# the image header and the file needs to be warped to apply the 
# transformation.
#

# Inputs:
# $1 is the input directory 
# $2 is the output directory
# $3 is the file extension for the input images.
# $4 is the output image resolution.

FILES=$1/*.$3
for f in $FILES

  echo "Processing $f file..."
  filename=`basename ${f} .${3}`
  echo "Output: ${2}/${filename}.kea"
  gdalwarp -r cubic -multi -wt Float32 -of KEA -tr $4 -$4 ${f} ${2}/${filename}.kea
  gdalcalcstats ${2}/${filename}.kea -ignore 0
